# 🎯 CRITICAL FIX: Resize Handles Blocking Drag

## ✅ Issue Identified from Logs

**Problem:** After resize completes successfully, trying to drag shows "no" cursor (⊘) and drag never starts.

**Evidence from Logs:**
```javascript
// Resize completes successfully:
✅ Resize state cleared - events should be draggable now
📊 ScheduledItem RENDER: {isBeingResized: false, disabled: false, hasListeners: true}
🔄 RESIZE STATE CHANGED: {isResizing: false}

// But when trying to drag:
(NO 🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT log!)
```

**Diagnosis:** 
- Resize state WAS cleared ✓
- Listeners WERE reattached ✓  
- But `handleDragStart` never fired ✗

**Root Cause:** The resize handles were **full-width strips** (`left-0 right-0`) covering the entire top and bottom edges. Even though they used `stopPropagation()`, they were intercepting ALL clicks on the event, preventing dnd-kit listeners from ever receiving the pointer events.

## ✅ The Fix

### **Changed Resize Handles from Full-Width to Small Nubs**

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```javascript
// Handle covered ENTIRE width
<div className="absolute left-0 right-0 -top-1 h-2 ...">
  // Full width bar that blocks all clicks at top edge
</div>
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Handle is only 48px wide, centered
<div className="absolute left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 top-0 w-12 h-3 ...">
  // Small centered nub that only captures intentional resize clicks
</div>
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **Top Handle:**
- Width: `left-0 right-0` → `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 w-12` (48px)
- Height: `h-2` → `h-3` (8px → 12px, easier to click)
- Position: Full edge → Centered nub
- Coverage: 100% → ~15% of top edge

### **Bottom Handle:**
- Width: `left-0 right-0` → `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 w-12` (48px)
- Height: `h-2` → `h-3`
- Position: Full edge → Centered nub
- Coverage: 100% → ~15% of bottom edge

### **Event Body:**
- Now: 85% of click area is draggable
- Only: Small centered nubs trigger resize
- Result: User can easily click to drag

## 📊 Console Output to Expect

### **After This Fix - Successful Drag:**
```javascript
// Place event
✅ Placed "Team Meeting" at 10:00 AM

// Resize it
🎯 Bottom resize handle clicked
🔧 Resize START
🖱️ MOUSE UP detected
🔧 Resize END (SNAPPED)
✅ Resize applied
🧹 Resize cleanup
🔄 RESIZE STATE CHANGED: {isResizing: false}
📊 ScheduledItem RENDER: {isBeingResized: false, hasListeners: true}

// Click event body to drag
🖱️ Event body clicked: {itemId: 'scheduled-1', isBeingResized: false, hasListeners: true}
🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT: {isResizing: false}  ← NOW FIRES!
✅ DRAG START ALLOWED  ← NOW WORKS!
👻 Ghost preview
✅ Moved "Team Meeting" to 2:00 PM
```

## 🎯 Key Insight

**The resize state WAS being cleared correctly.** The problem was **purely positional** - the resize handles were physically blocking pointer events from reaching the event body, even though they used `stopPropagation()`.

By making the handles small and centered (only 48px wide instead of full width), we:
- ✅ Still allow precise resizing (grab the nub)
- ✅ Allow dragging (click anywhere else on the event)
- ✅ Prevent accidental resize when trying to drag
- ✅ Fix the "no cursor" issue (handles not blocking body)

## 🧪 Test Again

**Please try this sequence:**

```
1. Clear console
2. Drag "Team Meeting" to 10:00 AM
3. Resize it (click the SMALL NUB at bottom, drag down)
4. Release
5. Click the EVENT BODY (not the nubs) and try to drag

Expected:
✅ See: 🖱️ Event body clicked
✅ See: 🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT
✅ See: ✅ DRAG START ALLOWED
✅ Event moves!
```
