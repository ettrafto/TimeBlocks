# 🎯 CRITICAL FIX: Cancel Active Drag on Resize Start

## ✅ Root Cause Identified!

**The Smoking Gun:**
```
⚠️ UNEXPECTED: Item is both resizing AND dragging!
📊 ScheduledItem RENDER: {isBeingResized: true, isDragging: true, disabled: true, hasListeners: false}
```

**Problem:** When you click a resize handle, dnd-kit's `PointerSensor` captures the mousedown event **before** `stopPropagation()` executes. This starts a drag operation, making `isDragging=true` even though the item is also being resized.

**Result:** The item is in both states simultaneously:
- `isBeingResized: true` (from resize)
- `isDragging: true` (from dnd-kit sensor)

This causes:
1. The drag transform tries to apply (causing jitter)
2. The drag state lingers after resize ends
3. Future drag attempts conflict with the "stuck" drag state

## ✅ The Fix

### **Cancel Active Drag When Resize Starts**

```javascript
const handleResizeStart = React.useCallback((item, edge, clientY) => {
  console.log('🔧 Resize START:', { 
    ...,
    BEFORE_activeId: activeId,  // Added logging
  });
  
  // CRITICAL FIX: Cancel any active drag that dnd-kit might have started
  // The sensor can capture mousedown before stopPropagation, causing isDragging=true
  if (activeId) {
    console.log('  🛑 Canceling active drag (activeId:', activeId, ') to start resize');
    setActiveId(null);  // ← THIS IS THE FIX
  }
  
  setIsResizing(true);
  setResizeTarget({...});
  setResizeDraft({...});
}, [isResizing, activeId]);  // Added activeId to deps
```

## 🔧 How This Fixes It

### **Event Sequence:**

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```
User clicks resize handle
  ↓
1. dnd-kit PointerSensor captures mousedown
   → Sets internal drag state
   → isDragging becomes true for that item
  ↓
2. stopPropagation() executes (too late)
  ↓
3. handleResizeStart executes
   → Sets isResizing=true
   → But isDragging is ALREADY true from step 1
  ↓
Result: isBeingResized=true AND isDragging=true
  ↓
Item tries to both drag and resize
  ↓
Chaos! ❌
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```
User clicks resize handle
  ↓
1. dnd-kit PointerSensor captures mousedown
   → Starts internal drag state
  ↓
2. handleResizeStart executes
   → Sees activeId is set (from step 1)
   → Calls setActiveId(null) ← CANCELS THE DRAG
   → Sets isResizing=true
  ↓
Result: isBeingResized=true, isDragging=false
  ↓
Only resize proceeds (drag canceled)
  ↓
Success! ✅
```

## 📊 Expected Console Output

### **When You Start Resize:**
```javascript
🔧 Resize START: {
  ...,
  BEFORE_activeId: 'scheduled-1',  ← Drag was starting!
}
🛑 Canceling active drag (activeId: scheduled-1) to start resize
➡️ SET isResizing=true, activeId=null, ...

📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Team Meeting]: {
  isBeingResized: true,
  isDragging: false,  ← NOW FALSE! (was true before)
  disabled: true,
  hasListeners: false,  ← Expected during resize
  willApplyTransform: false  ← No transform during resize
}

// NO MORE WARNING:
// ⚠️ UNEXPECTED: Item is both resizing AND dragging!
```

### **When Resize Completes:**
```javascript
🖱️ MOUSE UP detected
🔧 Resize END (SNAPPED)
✅ Resize applied
🧹 Resize cleanup
📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Team Meeting]: {
  isBeingResized: false,  ← Back to normal
  isDragging: false,
  disabled: false,
  hasListeners: true,  ← Listeners back!
  willApplyListeners: true
}
```

### **When You Drag After Resize:**
```javascript
🖱️ Event body clicked: {isBeingResized: false, hasListeners: true}
🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT: {isResizing: false, resizeDraftId: undefined}
✅ DRAG START ALLOWED
👻 Ghost preview
✅ Moved "Team Meeting" to 2:00 PM
```

## 🧪 Test Now

```
1. Clear console
2. Place event at 10:00 AM
3. Click bottom resize nub
4. Look for:
   ✅ 🛑 Canceling active drag
   ✅ NO "⚠️ UNEXPECTED" warning
   ✅ isDragging: false in render logs
5. Release (complete resize)
6. Click event body and drag
7. Look for:
   ✅ 🖱️ Event body clicked
   ✅ 🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT
   ✅ ✅ DRAG START ALLOWED
   ✅ Event moves!
```

## 📝 Summary

**The Issue:** dnd-kit sensor captured mousedown before stopPropagation, creating simultaneous drag+resize state

**The Fix:** Cancel activeId in handleResizeStart to abort any drag that started

**Lines Changed:** 4 lines added to handleResizeStart

**Impact:** Prevents drag/resize conflict, allows clean resize and subsequent drag

---

**This should completely fix the issue!** The drag will be canceled when resize starts, preventing the conflict. 🎯
