# 🔍 Diagnostic Logging Guide

## ✅ Comprehensive Logging Active

I've added detailed logging throughout the resize and drag systems. Here's what to look for:

---

## 🧪 Test Sequence

### **Step 1: Place an Event**
```
1. Drag "Team Meeting" from left panel to 10:00 AM
2. Watch console for:
   ✅ DRAG START ALLOWED
   👻 Ghost preview
   ✅ Placed "Team Meeting"
```

### **Step 2: Resize the Event**
```
1. Hover over bottom edge (cursor changes to ↕️)
2. Click and drag down
3. Watch console for:
   🔧 Resize START: {itemId: 'scheduled-1', BEFORE_isResizing: false}
   ➡️ SET isResizing=true
   📌 Attaching window resize listeners
   🔄 RESIZE STATE CHANGED: {isResizing: true, resizeTargetId: 'scheduled-1'}
   🔄 CalendarGrid: Item Meeting marked as isBeingResized=true
   📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Meeting]: {isBeingResized: true, willApplyListeners: false}
```

### **Step 3: Release Mouse (Complete Resize)**
```
1. Release mouse button
2. Watch console for:
   🖱️ MOUSE UP detected - calling handleResizeEnd
   🔧 Resize END (SNAPPED): {newStart: '...', snapped: 'Yes'}
   
   THEN ONE OF:
   
   A) No overlap:
      ✅ Resize applied: Meeting
      🧹 Resize cleanup (normal path): {BEFORE_isResizing: true, SETTING_TO: {...}}
      ✅ Resize state cleared - events should be draggable now
      📌 Removing window resize listeners
      🔄 RESIZE STATE CHANGED: {isResizing: false, resizeTargetId: undefined, resizeDraftId: undefined}
      📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Meeting]: {isBeingResized: false, hasListeners: true, willApplyListeners: true}
   
   B) With overlap:
      ⚠️ Resize creates overlap with: ...
      (Modal appears - wait for user action)
      
      Then if "Allow":
        ✅ User allowed overlap
        🧹 Overlap Allow - clearing resize state: {BEFORE_isResizing: true, ...}
        ✅ Overlap Allow complete - resize state cleared
        🔄 RESIZE STATE CHANGED: {isResizing: false, ...}
        📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Meeting]: {isBeingResized: false, hasListeners: true}
      
      Or if "Cancel":
        ❌ User canceled
        🧹 Overlap Cancel - clearing resize state: {BEFORE_isResizing: true, ...}
        ✅ Overlap Cancel complete - resize state cleared
        🔄 RESIZE STATE CHANGED: {isResizing: false, ...}
        📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Meeting]: {isBeingResized: false, hasListeners: true}
```

### **Step 4: Try to Drag the Event**
```
1. Click and try to drag the resized event
2. Watch console for:
   🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT: {activeId: 'scheduled-1', isResizing: false, resizeDraftId: undefined}
   
   THEN ONE OF:
   
   SUCCESS:
      ✅ DRAG START ALLOWED: {id: 'scheduled-1', type: 'scheduled', currentIsResizing: false}
      👻 Ghost preview: ...
   
   FAILURE:
      ❌ BLOCKED: Drag start ignored - resize in progress
      
      OR
      
      (Nothing - drag start never fires at all)
```

## 🎯 What to Report

### **Scenario A: Drag Works After Resize**
```
Copy the complete console output showing:
✅ 🔧 Resize START
✅ 🧹 Resize cleanup (or Overlap cleanup)
✅ 📊 ScheduledItem RENDER with isBeingResized: false, hasListeners: true
✅ ✅ DRAG START ALLOWED

Result: Everything working correctly!
```

### **Scenario B: Drag Blocked After Resize**
```
Copy console showing:
✅ 🔧 Resize START
✅ 🧹 Resize cleanup
❌ 🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT shows isResizing: true (should be false!)

OR

❌ 📊 ScheduledItem RENDER shows isBeingResized: true (should be false!)

OR

❌ 📊 ScheduledItem RENDER shows hasListeners: false
```

### **Scenario C: Drag Doesn't Even Try to Start**
```
Click event to drag:
❌ No 🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT in console

This means dnd-kit isn't even firing the event.
Check earlier logs for:
  📊 ScheduledItem RENDER - what are the props?
```

---

## 🔍 Key Diagnostics

### **Check 1: Is Resize State Cleared?**
Look for this sequence:
```
🔧 Resize END
🧹 Resize cleanup (normal path or Overlap path)
🔄 RESIZE STATE CHANGED: {isResizing: false, resizeTargetId: undefined, resizeDraftId: undefined}
```

**If missing:** Cleanup didn't execute properly

---

### **Check 2: Do Listeners Reattach?**
After cleanup, look for:
```
📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Meeting]: {
  isBeingResized: false,         ← Must be FALSE
  hasListeners: true,            ← Must be TRUE
  hasAttributes: true,           ← Must be TRUE
  willApplyListeners: true,      ← Must be TRUE
  disabled: false,               ← Must be FALSE
}
```

**If any are wrong:** Listeners not reattaching

---

### **Check 3: Does Drag Start Fire?**
When you click to drag:
```
🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT: {
  activeId: 'scheduled-1',
  isResizing: false,             ← Must be FALSE
  resizeDraftId: undefined,      ← Must be undefined
}
```

**If isResizing: true:** State wasn't cleared  
**If no log at all:** dnd-kit not detecting the drag

---

### **Check 4: Is Drag Allowed or Blocked?**
After DRAG START ATTEMPT:
```
SUCCESS:
✅ DRAG START ALLOWED: {currentIsResizing: false}

FAILURE:
❌ BLOCKED: Drag start ignored - resize in progress
```

## 📊 Complete Test Log Example

### **Expected Full Sequence:**

```javascript
// Initial render
📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Team Meeting]: {isBeingResized: false, hasListeners: true}

// Start resize
🔧 Resize START: {itemId: 'scheduled-1', BEFORE_isResizing: false}
➡️ SET isResizing=true, resizeTarget= scheduled-1
🔄 RESIZE STATE CHANGED: {isResizing: true, resizeTargetId: 'scheduled-1', resizeDraftId: 'scheduled-1'}
📌 Attaching window resize listeners
🔄 CalendarGrid: Item Team Meeting (scheduled-1) marked as isBeingResized=true
📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Team Meeting]: {isBeingResized: true, hasListeners: true, willApplyListeners: false}

// Release mouse
🖱️ MOUSE UP detected - calling handleResizeEnd
🔧 Resize END (SNAPPED): {event: 'Team Meeting', newStart: '10:00 AM', newDuration: '60 min'}
✅ Resize applied: Team Meeting
🧹 Resize cleanup (normal path): {BEFORE_isResizing: true, SETTING_TO: {...}}
✅ Resize state cleared - events should be draggable now
🔄 RESIZE STATE CHANGED: {isResizing: false, resizeTargetId: undefined, resizeDraftId: undefined}
📌 Removing window resize listeners
📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Team Meeting]: {isBeingResized: false, hasListeners: true, willApplyListeners: true, disabled: false}

// Try to drag
🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT: {activeId: 'scheduled-1', isResizing: false, resizeDraftId: undefined}
✅ DRAG START ALLOWED: {id: 'scheduled-1', type: 'scheduled', currentIsResizing: false}
👻 Ghost preview: {time: '2:00 PM'}
🏁 DRAG END: {activeId: 'scheduled-1', overId: 'calendar'}
✅ Moved "Team Meeting" to 2:00 PM
```

## 📋 What to Copy & Paste Back

Please perform this exact test and copy the COMPLETE console output:

```
TEST SEQUENCE:
1. Clear console (click 🚫 button)
2. Drag demo event "Team Meeting" to 10:00 AM
3. Resize it (drag bottom edge down slightly, then release)
4. If overlap modal appears, click "Allow" or "Cancel"
5. Try to drag the event to 2:00 PM

COPY EVERYTHING from console and paste it back.

Also note:
- Did the event animate/slide during resize? (Should NOT)
- Did the drag work after resize? (Should WORK)
- Any visual glitches?
```
