# 🗂️ Types Management & Event Deletion Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

Your calendar now features a complete **Types Management System** with event deletion:

1. **🗂️ Types CRUD** - Create, read, update, and delete event types
2. **🗑️ Event Deletion** - Delete event templates with confirmation
3. **📁 Type Association** - Link events to types with dropdown
4. **⚠️ Smart Warnings** - Shows affected events before type deletion
5. **🎨 Visual Indicators** - Type badges, edit/delete icons

---

## 🎯 Demo Data Included

The app starts with **2 demo types** and **2 demo events**:

### **Types:**
- **Work** (Blue)
- **Personal** (Green)

### **Events:**
- **Team Meeting** (30 min, Purple, Work type)
- **Lunch Break** (45 min, Green, Personal type)

This demonstrates the type association and allows immediate testing of type deletion warnings.

## 🎯 Type Association

### **In Event Editor:**
```
Type: [▼ Dropdown]
  ├─ No Type
  ├─ Work
  ├─ Personal
  └─ Exercise
```

### **On Event Card:**
```
┌────────────────────┐
│ Team Meeting       │
│ 30 minutes         │
│ 📁 Work            │ ← Shows associated type
└────────────────────┘
```

### **On Scheduled Calendar Event:**
Type is stored but not currently displayed (available for future features like filtering)

---

## 🔍 Overlap Detection Logic

### **Overlap Formula:**
```javascript
function checkOverlap(newEvent, existingEvents) {
  const newStart = newEvent.startMinutes;
  const newEnd = newEvent.startMinutes + newEvent.duration;
  
  return existingEvents.filter(existing => {
    const existingStart = existing.startMinutes;
    const existingEnd = existing.startMinutes + existing.duration;
    
    // Overlap condition
    return newStart < existingEnd && newEnd > existingStart;
  });
}
```

### **Examples:**
```
Event A: 10:00 ─── 10:30
Event B:      10:15 ─── 11:00
Result: OVERLAP ✓

Event A: 10:00 ─── 10:30
Event B:                10:30 ─── 11:00
Result: NO OVERLAP (touching is OK)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Type-Event Relationship:**
```
Types          Events (Templates)      Calendar (Scheduled)
┌──────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────┐
│ Work     │←─│ Team Meeting     │   │ Team Meeting     │
│ id: t1   │  │ typeId: t1       │──→│ 10:00-10:30      │
└──────────┘  └──────────────────┘   │ typeId: t1       │
                                      └──────────────────┘
```

### **Deletion Behavior:**

#### **Delete Type:**
```javascript
// Before:
Event: { name: "Meeting", typeId: "type-work" }

// After deleting "Work" type:
Event: { name: "Meeting", typeId: null }
```

#### **Delete Event Template:**
```javascript
// Template removed from taskTemplates array
// Scheduled instances in scheduledItems remain unchanged
// Each scheduled event is independent
```

## 📋 State Flow Diagrams

### **Creating Event with Type:**
```
User fills form
    ↓
Selects "Work" from dropdown
    ↓
Saves event
    ↓
Event stored: { ..., typeId: "type-work" }
    ↓
Renders with badge: "📁 Work"
    ↓
Drags to calendar
    ↓
Scheduled item: { ..., typeId: "type-work" }
```

### **Deleting Type with References:**
```
User clicks delete on "Work" type
    ↓
System counts: 3 events have typeId: "type-work"
    ↓
Warning: "...will affect 3 event(s)"
    ↓
User confirms
    ↓
Type deleted from types array
    ↓
All events: typeId "type-work" → null
    ↓
Type badges disappear from affected events
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### **Type Organization:**
```
Recommended type structure:
- Work (blue)
- Personal (green)
- Health (orange)
- Learning (purple)
- Social (pink)
```

### **Event Naming:**
```
Good:                    Avoid:
✓ Team Standup          ✗ Meeting
✓ Lunch Break           ✗ Lunch
✓ Gym Workout           ✗ Exercise
✓ Client Call           ✗ Call
```

### **Type vs Color:**
- **Type**: Categorical (Work, Personal, etc.)
- **Color**: Visual distinction within type
- Example: "Team Meeting" (Work, purple), "1-on-1" (Work, blue)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancement Ideas

With the type system in place, you can now add:

1. **Type Filtering** - Show/hide events by type
2. **Type Statistics** - Time spent per type
3. **Color Inheritance** - Auto-set event color from type
4. **Type Tags** - Multiple types per event
5. **Type-based Views** - Separate calendars per type
6. **Export by Type** - Download schedule filtered by type
