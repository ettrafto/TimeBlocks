# ⚠️ Overlap Detection & Confirmation Modal

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

Your time-blocking calendar now includes:
1. **Overlap Detection** - Automatically detects when events conflict
2. **Confirmation Modal** - Asks user permission before creating overlaps
3. **Smart Handling** - Works for both new events and repositioning

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **When Dropping a New Event:**
1. User drags task from left panel
2. Drops onto calendar
3. **System checks for overlaps** with existing events
4. If overlap found → **Modal appears**
5. User chooses: **Allow** or **Cancel**

### **When Repositioning an Event:**
1. User drags existing event to new time
2. **System checks for overlaps** (excluding the event being moved)
3. If overlap found → **Modal appears**
4. User chooses: **Allow** or **Cancel**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Overlap Detection Function:**

```javascript
function checkOverlap(newEvent, existingEvents) {
  const newStart = newEvent.startMinutes;
  const newEnd = newEvent.startMinutes + (newEvent.duration || 30);
  
  const overlappingEvents = existingEvents.filter(existing => {
    const existingStart = existing.startMinutes;
    const existingEnd = existing.startMinutes + (existing.duration || 30);
    
    // Overlap condition: new.start < existing.end AND new.end > existing.start
    return newStart < existingEnd && newEnd > existingStart;
  });
  
  return overlappingEvents;
}
```

### **Overlap Logic Explained:**

Two events overlap if:
```
Event A: |---------|
Event B:      |---------|
         ↑         ↑
         A.start < B.end AND A.end > B.start
```

**Examples:**

```
✅ OVERLAP:
Meeting:  10:00 ─── 10:30
Lunch:           10:15 ─── 11:00
(10:00 < 11:00 AND 10:30 > 10:15) → TRUE

✅ OVERLAP:
Meeting:  10:00 ───────── 11:00
Workout:      10:30 ─ 10:45
(10:00 < 10:45 AND 11:00 > 10:30) → TRUE

❌ NO OVERLAP:
Meeting:  10:00 ─── 10:30
Lunch:                    11:00 ─── 12:00
(10:00 < 12:00 AND 10:30 > 11:00) → FALSE
```

---

## 📊 State Management

### **New State Variables:**

```javascript
// Modal visibility
const [showOverlapModal, setShowOverlapModal] = useState(false);

// Event waiting for user confirmation
const [pendingEvent, setPendingEvent] = useState(null);

// Events that overlap with pending event
const [overlappingEvents, setOverlappingEvents] = useState([]);
```

### **Flow Diagram:**

```
Drop Event
    ↓
Check for overlaps
    ↓
   / \
  /   \
YES   NO
 ↓     ↓
Show  Add
Modal Event
 ↓
User Choice
   / \
  /   \
Allow Cancel
 ↓     ↓
Add   Discard
Event Event
```

## 🎯 User Actions

### **Action 1: Allow Overlap**
```javascript
const handleConfirmOverlap = () => {
  // Determines if new event or repositioning
  const isExistingEvent = scheduledItems.some(e => e.id === pendingEvent.id);
  
  if (isExistingEvent) {
    // Update existing event position
    setScheduledItems(prev => 
      prev.map(e => e.id === pendingEvent.id ? pendingEvent : e)
    );
  } else {
    // Add new event
    setScheduledItems(prev => [...prev, pendingEvent]);
    setNextId(prev => prev + 1);
  }
  
  // Close modal
  setShowOverlapModal(false);
  setPendingEvent(null);
  setOverlappingEvents([]);
};
```

### **Action 2: Cancel**
```javascript
const handleCancelOverlap = () => {
  console.log('❌ User canceled - discarding event');
  
  // Close modal without adding event
  setShowOverlapModal(false);
  setPendingEvent(null);
  setOverlappingEvents([]);
};
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **Test 1: Basic Overlap Detection**
```
1. Place "Lunch" (45 min) at 12:00 PM
   → Event scheduled: 12:00 PM - 12:45 PM

2. Try to place "Meeting" (30 min) at 12:15 PM
   → Modal appears!
   → Shows: "Overlaps with Lunch (12:00 PM - 12:45 PM)"

3. Click "Allow"
   → Meeting added at 12:15 PM
   → Both events visible (overlapping)

4. Try to place "Workout" (60 min) at 12:30 PM
   → Modal appears!
   → Shows both overlapping events: Lunch and Meeting

5. Click "Cancel"
   → Workout NOT added
   → Calendar unchanged
```

### **Test 2: No Overlap (Sequential Events)**
```
1. Place "Meeting" at 10:00 AM (ends 10:30 AM)
2. Place "Lunch" at 10:30 AM (starts exactly when Meeting ends)
   → NO modal!
   → Events placed sequentially
   → Back-to-back is allowed
```

### **Test 3: Repositioning with Overlap**
```
1. Place "Meeting" at 10:00 AM
2. Place "Lunch" at 2:00 PM
3. Drag "Meeting" to 2:15 PM
   → Modal appears!
   → "Meeting overlaps with Lunch"
4. Click "Allow"
   → Meeting repositioned
5. Drag "Meeting" back to 10:00 AM
   → No modal (no overlap)
   → Meeting repositioned
```

### **Test 4: Multiple Overlaps**
```
1. Place "Meeting" at 10:00 AM (30 min)
2. Place "Study" at 10:15 AM (90 min)
3. Try to place "Workout" (60 min) at 10:00 AM
   → Modal shows BOTH overlapping events:
      • Meeting (10:00 AM - 10:30 AM)
      • Study (10:15 AM - 11:45 AM)
```

## 📝 Console Logging

### **No Overlap:**
```javascript
✅ Placed "Meeting" at 10:00 AM (30 min duration, height: 40px)
```

### **Overlap Detected (New Event):**
```javascript
⚠️ Overlap detected with: Lunch
// Modal appears
```

### **User Allows:**
```javascript
✅ User allowed overlap - processing event: Meeting
```

### **User Cancels:**
```javascript
❌ User canceled - discarding event: Meeting
```

### **Overlap Detected (Repositioning):**
```javascript
🔄 Repositioning event: Meeting from 10:00 AM to 2:15 PM
⚠️ Reposition would overlap with: Lunch
// Modal appears
```

---

## 🎨 Modal Component

### **Props:**
- `isOpen` (boolean) - Show/hide modal
- `title` (string) - Modal title
- `children` (ReactNode) - Modal content
- `onConfirm` (function) - Called when "Allow" clicked
- `onCancel` (function) - Called when "Cancel" clicked

### **Features:**
- ✅ Centered overlay with backdrop
- ✅ Click outside to cancel
- ✅ Escape key support (built-in)
- ✅ Accessible buttons
- ✅ Smooth transitions
- ✅ Responsive design

### **Styling:**
```javascript
// Overlay: Semi-transparent black background
className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50"

// Modal: White card, centered
className="relative bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl p-6"

// Buttons: Gray for Cancel, Blue for Allow
Cancel: "bg-gray-200 text-gray-700"
Allow:  "bg-blue-600 text-white"
```

## 💡 Edge Cases Handled

### **1. Event Exactly Touches (No Overlap):**
```
Meeting: 10:00 ─── 10:30
Lunch:                10:30 ─── 11:00

10:00 < 11:00 ✓
10:30 > 10:30 ✗

Result: NO OVERLAP (allowed)
```

### **2. Repositioning to Same Spot:**
```
Move event from 10:00 to 10:00
→ No change, no overlap check needed
→ Event stays in place
```

### **3. Self-Exclusion During Reposition:**
```
When checking overlaps for repositioning:
otherEvents = scheduledItems.filter(e => e.id !== movingEvent.id)

This prevents an event from "overlapping with itself"
```

### **4. Partial Overlap:**
```
Meeting:  10:00 ───────── 11:00
Lunch:           10:30 ─────── 12:00

Even 1 minute of overlap triggers modal
```

## 🚀 User Experience Benefits

### **Before (No Overlap Detection):**
❌ Events stack on top of each other  
❌ Hard to see what's happening  
❌ Accidental double-booking  
❌ No warning system  

### **After (With Overlap Detection):**
✅ Clear warning when conflicts occur  
✅ User makes informed decision  
✅ Shows exactly which events conflict  
✅ Prevents accidental overlaps  
✅ Still allows intentional overlaps  

---

## 🎯 Customization Options

### **Change Modal Styling:**
```javascript
// In Modal component, modify:
className="bg-white rounded-lg"  // Card style
className="bg-black bg-opacity-50"  // Backdrop darkness
```

### **Change Button Labels:**
```javascript
// In Modal component:
<button>Cancel</button>  // Change to "No" or "Discard"
<button>Allow</button>   // Change to "Yes" or "Proceed"
```

### **Add Warning Level Colors:**
```javascript
// For severe overlaps (multiple conflicts):
{overlappingEvents.length > 2 && (
  <div className="bg-red-100 border-red-300">
    Warning: {overlappingEvents.length} conflicts!
  </div>
)}
```

### **Auto-Suggest Alternative Times:**
```javascript
// In modal content:
<p>Suggested times without conflicts:</p>
<ul>
  {findAvailableSlots().map(slot => (
    <li>{formatTime(slot)}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

System: ⚠️ Overlap with "Lunch" (12:00-12:45)
System: [Shows modal]

Modal: "Time Conflict Detected
        Meeting overlaps with:
        • Lunch (12:00 PM - 12:45 PM)
        
        Do you want to schedule anyway?"

User: [Clicks "Allow"]
System: ✅ Event added
