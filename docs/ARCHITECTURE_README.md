## Document Created
✅ **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** (1,107 lines)

## Completeness Checklist

### ✅ Section 1: Overview
- Project purpose and features documented
- Full tech stack enumerated (React, Tailwind, @dnd-kit, Vite)
- High-level features list (7 major features)
- Pages/routes (single-page app, no routing)

### ✅ Section 2: Project Structure

- Inline notes for each folder's purpose
- Clear separation: components, utils, constants

### ✅ Section 3: Core Architecture
- App composition with DndContext structure
- Drag/drop integration with @dnd-kit explained
- Resize integration with state machine documented
- Zoom/pan integration with event flow
- Performance patterns identified (callbacks, conditional rendering)

### ✅ Section 4: Components (12 Components Documented)
Each component includes:
- **Purpose** & location
- **Props** table (name, type, required, description)
- **Side effects** (event listeners, console logs)
- **External dependencies** (@dnd-kit hooks)

Components covered:
1. CalendarGrid
2. ScheduledItem
3. ScheduledItemPreview
4. GhostEvent
5. DraggableTaskBlock
6. TaskBlock
7. Modal
8. EventEditorModal
9. TypeManagerModal
10. DndEventMonitor

### ✅ Section 5: Hooks
- Documented that app uses **inline state management** (no custom hooks)
- Listed all React hooks used (useState, useCallback, useEffect, useRef)
- Listed all @dnd-kit hooks (useSensor, useDraggable, useDroppable, useDndMonitor)
- State management pattern documented with all 15+ state variables
- Important invariants explained (resize blocks drag, single resize, no dual draggables)
- Edge cases documented (drag during resize, missing ghost position, missing calendar element)

### ✅ Section 6: Data Model
Three primary entities documented:
1. **EventTemplate** - Full schema with fields, creation/update/delete flows
2. **ScheduledEvent** - Full schema with lifecycle
3. **Type** - Full schema with relationships

**Derived data**:
- Position calculations (minutes ↔ pixels)
- Snapping logic (15-minute grid)
- Bounds clamping (8 AM - 5 PM)
- Overlap detection algorithm

**Persistence**: Documented as ephemeral (no backend/localStorage)

### ✅ Section 7: Interactions & Flows
Three complete end-to-end flows:

**Drag & Drop**:
- Template → Calendar (3-step flow with code-level detail)
- Scheduled Event Reposition (resilient to collision detection misses)
- Collision detection & transform logic

**Resize**:
- Start Resize (sensor disabling, preview switch)
- Live Resize (mousemove with live draft updates)
- Commit Resize (snapping, overlap check, state cleanup)
- Constraints documented (minimum duration, grid snapping, bounds)

**Zoom & Pan**:
- Zoom flow (Ctrl+Scroll with bounds 10-80px)
- Pan flow (drag-to-scroll with blocked-during-resize)

**Modal flows**:
- Overlap warning (3 trigger conditions)
- Event editor (create vs edit)
- Type manager (CRUD with cascade delete)

### ✅ Section 8: Utils & Constants
**Time Math** (`time.js`):
- 8 functions documented with examples

**Overlap Detection** (`overlap.js`):
- Algorithm documented with code snippet

**Diagnostics** (`diagnostics.js`):
- Duplicate detection pattern explained

**Constants**:
- Calendar config (hours, slots, zoom limits)
- Color options (10 Tailwind classes)

### ✅ Section 9: State & Side Effects
**State boundaries**:
- Global state (15 variables in App.jsx)
- Local state (modal forms, scroll state)
- No context usage

**Effects syncing with DOM/Window**:
- CalendarGrid wheel + drag listeners
- App resize listeners with flag prevention
- ScheduledItem assertion effects
- All with cleanup documented

**Error handling**:
- Console logging strategy (error vs warn)
- User alerts (confirm, alert)
- Modal warnings (overlap detection)
- No error boundaries

### ✅ Section 10: Build, Scripts, and Environments
- **Commands**: dev, build, preview documented
- **Environment variables**: None (documented as such)
- **Vite config**: Minimal config shown
- **Tailwind config**: Content paths documented
- **PostCSS**: Plugin setup shown
- **ESLint**: no-console rule documented
- **TypeScript**: Not used (documented)

### ✅ Section 11: Testing
- Current state: No tests present
- Documented absence of test files, runners, coverage
- Recommendations provided (Vitest, RTL, @dnd-kit/testing-utils)

### ✅ Section 12: Future Work / Known Limitations
**10 Known Limitations**:
1. No persistence
2. No event deletion UI
3. No multi-day support
4. No undo/redo
5. No keyboard shortcuts
6. No touch support
7. No event recurrence
8. Limited time range
9. No accessibility
10. No export

**Suggested Improvements**:
- Stability (error boundaries, PropTypes/TS, tests)
- Performance (memoization, React.memo, debouncing)
- Scalability (context, split components, custom hooks, persistence)
- UX (visual feedback, tooltips, keyboard shortcuts)
- Features (deletion, multi-day, search, export, dark mode)

### ✅ Appendix: Data Flow Diagram
Complete example flow from user interaction through DOM update with concrete drag-and-drop example.
