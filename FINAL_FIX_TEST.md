# 🎯 Final Fixes Applied - Test Instructions

## ✅ Surgical Fixes Completed

I've applied precise fixes to handle the case where `over` is null/undefined after resize:

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **Fix 1: Null-Safe Calendar Lookup** (handleDragMove, line ~1439)
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const calendarElement = over.node?.current || document.querySelector(...);

// AFTER:
const calendarElement = over?.node?.current || calendarDomRef.current || document.querySelector(...);
//                       ^^ Added null-safe operator and calendarDomRef fallback
```

### **Fix 2: Template-Only 'over' Requirement** (handleDragEnd, line ~1550)
```javascript
// BEFORE:
if (over?.id !== 'calendar') return; // Blocked ALL drags

// AFTER:
if (activeData?.type === 'template') {
  if (over?.id !== 'calendar') return; // Only block templates
}
// Scheduled drags proceed even if over is missing
```

### **Fix 3: Resize Handles Made Smaller** (ScheduledItem, line ~727)
```javascript
// BEFORE: Full-width strips
className="absolute left-0 right-0 ... h-2"

// AFTER: Small centered nubs (48px wide)
className="absolute left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 ... w-12 h-3"
```

### **Fix 4: Transform Gating** (ScheduledItem, line ~687)
```javascript
// Already fixed - kept as-is:
transform: (isDragging && !isBeingResized && transform) ? ... : undefined
```

### **Fix 5: Resize State Cleanup** (Overlap handlers)
```javascript
// Added to both handleConfirmOverlap and handleCancelOverlap:
setIsResizing(false);
setResizeTarget(null);
setResizeDraft(null);
```

## 🧪 Test Sequence

### **Clear console, then run this:**

```
1. Drag "Team Meeting" from left panel to 10:00 AM

2. Resize it:
   - Click the SMALL NUB at bottom center
   - Drag down slightly
   - Release

3. Immediately drag the event:
   - Click the EVENT BODY (purple area, not the nubs)
   - Drag to 2:00 PM
   - Release
```

## 📊 Expected Console Output

### **After Resize:**
```javascript
🔧 Resize START: {itemId: 'scheduled-1', BEFORE_isResizing: false}
🖱️ MOUSE UP detected
🔧 Resize END (SNAPPED): {newDuration: '45 min', snapped: 'Yes'}
✅ Resize applied
🧹 Resize cleanup (normal path)
✅ Resize state cleared - events should be draggable now
🔄 RESIZE STATE CHANGED: {isResizing: false, resizeDraftId: undefined}
📊 ScheduledItem RENDER [Team Meeting]: {
  isBeingResized: false,
  disabled: false,
  hasListeners: true,
  willApplyListeners: true,
  willApplyTransform: false  ← Correct (not dragging yet)
}
```

### **When You Click Event Body:**
```javascript
🖱️ Event body clicked: {
  itemId: 'scheduled-1',
  isBeingResized: false,
  hasListeners: true
}
```

### **When Drag Starts:**
```javascript
🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT: {
  activeId: 'scheduled-1',
  isResizing: false,  ← Must be FALSE
  resizeDraftId: undefined  ← Must be undefined
}
✅ DRAG START ALLOWED: {type: 'scheduled', currentIsResizing: false}
```

### **During Drag:**
```javascript
// May see one of these:
ℹ️ Scheduled drag: over is missing/wrong, using fallback calculation
// OR
✓ Using ghost position for scheduled drag

👻 Ghost preview: {time: '2:00 PM', ...}
```

### **On Drop:**
```javascript
🏁 DRAG END: {activeId: 'scheduled-1', overId: 'calendar' or null}

// Then one of:
✓ Using ghost position for scheduled drag
// OR
⚠️ FALLBACK: No ghost - calculating from delta (common post-resize)
✓ Calculated finalMinutes from delta: 2:00 PM

🔄 Repositioning event: Team Meeting from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM
✅ Moved "Team Meeting" to 2:00 PM
```

---

## ⚠️ What to Watch For

### **✅ SUCCESS Indicators:**
- 🖱️ Event body clicked (body receives clicks)
- 🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT (drag is attempted)
- ✅ DRAG START ALLOWED (drag proceeds)
- ℹ️ or ✓ message (ghost calculated, possibly via fallback)
- ✅ Moved to new time

### **❌ FAILURE Indicators:**
- No 🖱️ Event body clicked (handles still blocking)
- No 🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT (dnd-kit not receiving events)
- ❌ BLOCKED message (resize state not cleared)
- ⚠️ CRITICAL: Transform applied during resize

---

## 🎯 Specific Things to Note

### **1. Can You Click the Event Body?**
```
After resize, click the purple/colored area
Expected: 🖱️ Event body clicked
If missing: Handles still blocking (shouldn't happen with 48px nubs)
```

### **2. Does Drag Start?**
```
After clicking body:
Expected: 🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT
If missing: dnd-kit sensors not firing (check cursor, should be grab not no-symbol)
```

### **3. Is Ghost Calculated?**
```
During drag:
Expected: ✓ Using ghost OR ⚠️ FALLBACK: No ghost
If neither: Ghost calculation failing
```

### **4. No Transform During Resize?**
```
While resizing:
Expected: willApplyTransform: false
If true: Will see ❌ CRITICAL error
```

## 📋 Report Back

Please copy:

```
VISUAL RESULTS:
1. During resize - did event "slide" or animate? [Yes/No]
2. After resize - what cursor appears over event body? [grab/no-symbol/other]
3. After resize - did drag work? [Yes/No]

CONSOLE OUTPUT:
[Paste complete output from resize through attempted drag]

KEY QUESTIONS:
- Do you see "🖱️ Event body clicked"? [Yes/No]
- Do you see "🎬 DRAG START ATTEMPT"? [Yes/No]
- Do you see "✅ DRAG START ALLOWED"? [Yes/No]
- Any ❌ CRITICAL errors? [Yes/No]
```

## 🚀 Expected Result

With these fixes:
- ✅ Small nubs (48px) don't block clicks
- ✅ Event body receives click events  
- ✅ dnd-kit sensors fire
- ✅ Drag starts successfully
- ✅ Ghost calculates (with fallback if needed)
- ✅ Event moves correctly

**The resize handles are now properly scoped and won't interfere!** 🎯
